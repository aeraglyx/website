<div class="about">
    <p>Hi, I'm a VFX artist / TD / recreational programmer. At work we use Blender, so I make in-house tools like node groups, add-ons and scripts, but I also enjoy some compositing and anything math/physics related. In the free time I'm tweaking my dotfiles, writing this website and occasionally touching grass.</p>
